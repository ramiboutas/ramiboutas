<p>👋 Hi, I'm Rami, welcome to my GitHub bio.</p>
<p>👷 Officially I am a mechanical &amp; industrial engineer. I came accross with programming (or coding) by using MATLAB during my studies.</p>
<p>😐 OK... working with MATLAB may not be programming/coding for some developers, but for me it was and still it is. </p>
<p>📚 In Summer 2019, I decided to learn the real programming languages (C#, Java , JavaScript and Python). I sticked with Python due these reasons: huge amount of libraries, language syntax and simple to understand.</p>
<p>👨🏽‍💻 Now, I exercise mentally with coding and physically in the gym.</p>
<p>🏋️‍♀️ Sometimes, I consider my <em>self</em> as a nerd who lifts weights. </p>
<p>🧠 Learning about Psychology &amp; human behavior fascinates me.</p>

<p>🏫 I grown up in Spain</p>
<p>🚞 Now, I'm based in Kempten, Germany.</p>
